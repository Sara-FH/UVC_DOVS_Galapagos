This folder contains raw data. By this I mean unprocessed files that have been cleaned and checked for errors.
We already cleaned this dataset in the map creation script. There is no need to do the work again.

The same thing should be applied for all raw datasets that have now been processed, AND for which we have a new clean file saved in the Data folder.
