```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Methods comparison

Use this markdown document to clean the UVC and DOVS data and compare the two methods.


### Data Cleaning
By using the line below you can clean your data.

```{r Data Cleaning}
source("1_DataCleaning.R")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
